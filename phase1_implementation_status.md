## Checklist for Full Phase 1 Completion

- [ ] Each file implements the critical classes, methods, or logic for its task/subtasks.
- [ ] All verification steps (from your plan) are supported (unit tests, logic, docs).
- [ ] No placeholder files; all modules are functional or properly stubbed.
- [ ] Code has docstrings and clear interfaces for future contributors.
- [ ] Scaffolding present for future extensibility as described in the implementation plan.
- [ ] No orphan or "extra" files in `integrations/registry/` not reflected in the plan (e.g., interface_registry.py — check if intentional/needed).

---

## Recommendations

1. **Systematically review and update each implementation file**, ensuring:
   - Abstract classes, interfaces, methods, and event bus systems are not just stubbed, but provide at least minimal operational functionality per your plan.
   - Placeholder content is replaced with real logic or explicit `NotImplementedError`/TODO markers and signatures.
   - Threading/event bus/registry patterns follow the structure outlined in your "subtasks".

2. **Scaffold or expand basic unit tests** for each module and verification step, in the `tests/integration/` directory if not already present.

3. **Document each module** with docstrings and API specifications, if not done.

4. **Remove or repurpose orphan files** (e.g., `interface_registry.py` in registry) to avoid codebase confusion.

5. If you wish, **I can auto-generate complete minimal example implementations** for any Phase 1 file/module that's not yet meeting the plan, or for which the content does not exist.

**Next Action:**  
- Let me know if you want to see implementation reviews for any individual module, or if you’d like me to auto-complete or enhance any of these modules for full plan compliance.
