Minimal stub. Do NOT import submodules here during modular split/testing phase.
All submodules should be referenced directly (e.g., from integrations.monitoring import health_status).
This avoids Python circular import issues during TDD phase.
When all modules are implemented and stable, public API symbols can be re-exposed here if desired.
