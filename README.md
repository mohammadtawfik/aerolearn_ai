## Architecture Overview

AeroLearn AI uses a **modular, event-driven architecture** aligning with modern best practices for extensibility and testability:

- **Event Bus System:** Enables loose coupling and cross-component messaging
- **Component Registry:** Centralizes lifecycle and dependency management
- **Interface Contracts:** Standardized interfaces for major functional areas
- **Monitoring Foundation:** Built-in tools for health metrics and status tracking
- **Separation of Concerns:** Clear split between core domain, integrations, and UI logic
