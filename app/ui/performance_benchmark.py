"""
UI Performance Benchmarking Framework

Provides protocol-aligned scaffolding for UI and system component performance benchmarking,
in direct response to the modular benchmarks tested in /tests/unit/ui/test_ui_performance_benchmarks.py.

- No actual GUI or backend imported as per environment/documentation rules.
- Designed for future extension only after test expansion (strict TDD).
- All logic, interface, and docstring structure guided by /docs/development/day22_plan.md, /code_summary.md,
  and protocols described in /docs/architecture/architecture_overview.md
