"""
UI Automation Framework Module

Implements scaffolding for protocol-driven UI testing automation as mandated by Day 22 Task 4.1.4 and the modular test suite in /tests/unit/ui/test_ui_component_automation.py.

Features:
 - Workflow simulation foundations (user event chains on UI components)
 - Event recording and playback infrastructure
 - Visual regression protocol hook (baseline state management)
 - (Stub) Backend integration interface

Documentation:
 - In direct alignment with /docs/development/day22_plan.md, /code_summary.md, and /docs/architecture/architecture_overview.md.
 - All features to be extended strictly TDD: test -> protocol -> implementation.

NOTE: Does NOT import PyQt or any GUI libraries directly, in compliance with Day 22 environment rules.
