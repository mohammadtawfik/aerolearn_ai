# Content Management Integration Testing â€“ AeroLearn AI

## Overview

This document describes the integration test plan, results, and component interactions for Content Management as required by Task 9.4. It includes upload workflows, batch operations, metadata synchronization, and content type detection.

---

## Integration Test Coverage

### 1. Upload & Metadata Workflow

- Tests simulate full file uploads (via UI or service layer), check upload DB and metadata persistence.
- Mixed formats tested: PDF, images, video, presentations, and text.
- Uploads are verified for completion against the content DB and metadata manager.

### 2. Batch Operations With Mixed Content Types

- Uses batch controller to start batch uploads of various file types.
- Aggregates and validates progress via event listeners.
- Ensures batch completion signs off on each content type, and all events fire as expected.

### 3. Metadata Consistency Across Components

- After uploads, queries metadata manager, content DB, and widget/batch for consistent content_type and filename fields.
- Validates agreement with UI detection routines.

### 4. Content Type Detection Accuracy

- Leverages ContentTypeRegistry to detect file types using both extension and (optionally) its strategy plugins.
- Each file tested must yield the expected category (pdf, image, video, text, presentation, etc.).

### 5. Documentation and Issues

- Integration test results are output and issues listed if found.
- Any failures prompt issue filing for prompt resolution.

## Components Under Test

- **ProfessorUploadWidget** (`app.ui.professor.upload_widget`)
- **BatchUploadController** (`app.core.upload.batch_controller`)
- **ContentDB** (`app.core.db.content_db`)
- **MetadataManager** (`app.models.metadata_manager`)
- **ContentTypeRegistry** (`app.models.content_type_registry`)

## Methodology

1. Pytest-based integration suite (see `/tests/integration/test_content_management_workflow.py`)
2. Mocked and real classes are mixed as necessary for isolation vs. realism.
3. Temp files of each primary supported type are created and processed.
4. Batch operations and associated listeners are checked for event firing and correct state changes.
5. Detected integration issues are documented and, if test fails, will be reported.

## Results

- All functional areas above are tested and must pass before integration is considered successful.
- Test log and asserted output serve as living documentation for system integrity.

## Integration Issues

- Any test failure triggers investigation and resolution before deployment.
- If a breaking boundary is discovered (e.g. inconsistent content_type), issue is filed and process repeated.
