# UI Testing Automation and Performance Benchmarks

**Project:** AeroLearn AI  
**Location:** `/docs/ui/ui_testing_and_performance_benchmarks.md`  
**Syncs:** Code and test state as of Day 22, strictly per `/docs/development/day22_plan.md`, `/code_summary.md`, and `/docs/architecture/architecture_overview.md`.

---

## Scope

- Describes the design, protocol, and structure for UI testing automation and performance benchmarking.
- Details modular test and implementation structure.
- Ensures auditability and maintenance per project procedures.

---

## 1. UI Automation Framework

**Code Location:** `/app/ui/automation_framework.py`  
- Provides protocol-driven hooks for:
    - Workflow simulation (UI event chains, action replay)
    - UI event recording/playback for testing purposes
    - Visual regression baseline/capture stubs
    - Backend/public API integration validators  
- NO GUI libraries are initialized or imported unless in a strict environment per `/docs/development/day22_plan.md`.

**Tests:** `/tests/unit/ui/test_ui_component_automation.py`

---

## 2. UI Performance Benchmark Suite

**Implementation:** `/app/ui/performance_benchmark.py`  
- Components:
    - `UIComponentPerformanceBenchmarker`: Render/init speed
    - `UIWorkflowThroughputBenchmarker`: Actions throughput
    - `VisualRegressionPerformanceBenchmarker`: Visual regression check benchmarks
    - `UIBackendLatencyBenchmarker`: UI/backend latency

**Tests:** `/tests/unit/ui/test_ui_performance_benchmarks.py`
- Each test:
    - Is modularâ€”one protocol surface per test.
    - Verifies all methods/classes' contract and type, even for scaffolding.
    - Must pass on every commit/merge for integrity.

---

## 3. Protocol & Documentation Alignment

- Follows project structure as defined in `/code_summary.md`.
- Meets TDD/test-first as mandated by `/docs/development/day22_plan.md`.
- Clearly separates UI, performance, and integration concerns in tests and code.
- All changes and new files are **fully documented here and in the doc index** after implementation/testing.

---

## 4. Audit & Future Extension

- All new UI or performance code must be immediately accompanied by matching modular tests.
- Updates to this documentation are required concurrent with code/test changes.
- See `/docs/development/day22_plan.md` and `/docs/doc_index.md` for audit procedures.
