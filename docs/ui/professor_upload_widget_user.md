# Professor Upload: User Guide

## Purpose

The file upload tool lets you add course materials (PDFs, lecture slides, images, videos, etc.) for student access. You can use simple drag-and-drop or browse your computer.

## Steps

1. **Open Material Upload**
   - Choose the “Upload Material” option (location varies by course or module).

2. **Add Files**
   - _Drag-and-Drop_ your file(s) onto the marked upload zone.
   - Or, click **Select Files** to choose from your computer.

3. **File Validation**
   - Only supported file types (PDF, images, videos, text, PowerPoint, ZIP) are accepted.
   - Errors will be shown if your file type isn’t allowed.

4. **Upload Progress**
   - Each file will show a progress bar. Wait for the progress bar to reach 100%.

5. **Upload Complete**
   - Success will be indicated. You may now continue to add more material or close the window.

## Troubleshooting

- If a file fails validation, check the file format.
- If uploads fail to complete, check your network or contact technical support.
- For very large files, upload may take a while—progress is shown for each file.
