# AeroLearn AI â€“ Admin Security Model & Authentication Flow

**Status:**  
_All features specified for secure admin authentication, MFA, permissions, session management/activity logging, and permission-based admin dashboard are implemented and tested._  
- See `/app/core/auth/authentication.py`, `/tests/ui/test_admin_auth.py`.

## 1. Admin Authentication Process

- **Credential Verification**: Admins must provide username and password. Credentials verified using the CredentialManager.
- **Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)**: After password check, a time-based code (TOTP-style) must be provided. Codes are generated client-side with a secret linked per admin user, validated via MFAProvider.
- **Session Issuance**: On successful MFA, a secure session is created (SessionManager), tagged with role and activity tracking.

## 2. Roles & Permissions

- **Roles**: `admin`, `superadmin` defined for admin UI. Roles are registered in the AuthorizationManager.
- **Permissions**: Key permissions include:
    - `admin_dashboard:view`
    - `admin:user_manage`
    - `admin:course_manage`
    - `admin:system_monitor`
    - `admin:security_config`
- Roles are mapped to permissions. Admin users get all dashboard/management permissions; superadmins may have extra configuration rights.

## 3. Admin Dashboard UI Access

- Users must have an active session with at least `admin_dashboard:view` permission.
- All admin pages check for appropriate permissions before rendering content or navigation links.

## 4. Session Management & Activity Logging

- Activity (login attempts, permission enforcement failures, etc.) is logged per admin session for audit and monitoring.
- Sessions track creation, last activity time, role, and are invalidated on logout or timeout.
- Admin session activity can be accessed from backend for monitoring.

## 5. Testing, Verification, and Extensibility

- All major backend/auth/permission paths are covered by automated unit tests (see `/tests/ui/test_admin_auth.py`).
- MFA mechanism can be extended to hardware keys (e.g., FIDO), email/SMS without modifying main auth logic.
- Audit logs can be pushed to persistent storage or external logging services for compliance.
- Permission/role assignments are modular and extendable via AuthorizationManager.
- Admin UI leverages permission system for fine-grained access control.
