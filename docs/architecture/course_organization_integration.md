# AeroLearn AI â€” Course Organization Integration

## Overview

Describes the integration of course structure, categorization, and tagging features across UI, data, and search workflows.

---

## Components

- **CourseStructureEditor UI** (`/app/ui/common/course_structure_editor.py`):  
  Combines hierarchical drag/drop editing with category and tag assignment editors.

- **CategoryMultiSelect UI** (`/app/ui/common/category_multiselect.py`):  
  Embedded for category assignment.

- **TagAutocomplete UI** (`/app/ui/common/tag_autocomplete.py`):  
  Embedded for tag assignment and editing.

- **CourseOrganizationSearch UI** (`/app/ui/common/course_organization_search.py`):  
  Provides search/filter by category or tag across courses, modules, lessons.

- **Backend search and filtering** (`/app/models/tag_search.py`):  
  Exposes functions for tag-based and category-based retrieval.

## Integration Workflows

1. **Editing Workflow**
    - User modifies structure in CourseStructureEditor.
    - Selects modules/lessons and assigns/removes categories/tags.
    - UI updates category/tag widgets and persists to DB.

2. **Search/Filter Workflow**
    - User enters tag/category query in search UI.
    - UI calls backend search functions or services to filter content.
    - Results shown in CourseOrganizationSearch list.

3. **Propagation & Consistency**
    - Changes in category/tag assignment propagate to all dependent lists and filters.
    - Tag/category suggestions presented where content allows.

---

## UI-to-Backend Data Passing

- The UI editors collect selected IDs/values from category and tag widgets.
- On save/update, backend receives assignments for persistence.

## Future Expansion

- Hook search/filter to live API endpoints.
- Integrate with AI suggestion engines for auto-labelling.
- Add bulk assignment/edit scripts or automation.
