# Week 2 Integration Architecture Overview

**Location:** `/docs/architecture/integration_architecture.md`

## Purpose

This document details the design, major components, and flows for Week 2 system integration as implemented in Task 14.3 of the AeroLearn AI project.

---

## Key Integration Points

- **Content Management ↔ Storage Services:**  
  Using `Week2Orchestrator.sync_content_with_storage()`, content objects from the database are checked and synchronized with external storage, via the `StorageInterface`.

- **Content Indexing ↔ AI Analysis Pipeline:**  
  Content items are processed to generate AI embeddings with `Week2Orchestrator.index_content_with_ai()`, connecting database content to AI-powered indexing.

- **Admin Tools ↔ Cross-component Monitoring:**  
  System health and integration metrics are aggregated and exposed to the admin UI through `Week2Orchestrator.link_admin_to_monitoring()`, utilizing the `SystemMonitorUI`.

- **Content Similarity Detection ↔ Admin Interfaces:**  
  Similarity analytics computed by `ContentSimilarityEngine` are communicated to the admin interface via `Week2Orchestrator.connect_similarity_to_admin()`.

## Modules and Their Roles

- `/integrations/week2/orchestrator.py`:  
  The main orchestrator for end-to-end workflow integration. Coordinates actions and dependencies for the above linkages.

- `/app/core/integration/integration_coordinator.py`:  
  Provides a unified API/facade for the core application layer to invoke all orchestrator-driven integrations.

- `/app/models/content.py`, `/app/core/db/content_db.py`:  
  Content models and storage, source for integration workflows.

- `/integrations/interfaces/storage_interface.py`:  
  Interface contract for adaptable storage connectors.

- `/integrations/interfaces/ai_interface.py`:  
  Contract for all AI-powered content analysis.

- `/app/core/ai/content_similarity.py`:  
  Provides unified similarity computation API under `ContentSimilarityEngine`.

- `/app/ui/admin/system_config.py`:  
  Admin-facing UI hooks for integration health and analytics.

- `/integrations/monitoring/integration_health.py`:  
  Supplies system-wide health and status metrics for integrated systems.

## Extending and Testing

- Extend orchestrator methods to handle new content types, advanced storage, or additional admin features.
- The integration is fully covered by `/tests/integration/test_week2_integration.py` using real and stubbed system components.
