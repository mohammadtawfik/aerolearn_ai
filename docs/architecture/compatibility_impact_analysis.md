# AeroLearn AI Compatibility Impact Analysis

**Location:** `/docs/architecture/compatibility_impact_analysis.md`  
**Document Type:** Implementation Protocol & Methodology  
**Applies to:** Day 21, Task 3.7.5

---

## Purpose

This document specifies the methodology, API contract, and practical usage of AeroLearn AI's Compatibility Impact Analysis system, built to fulfill Day 21 requirements for TDD-driven compatibility risk management and API change propagation.

---

## 1. Overview

The Compatibility Impact Analysis subsystem provides:

- **API change detection** for components and features
- **Impact propagation** across components and registered feature dependencies
- **Compatibility risk scoring** for architectural and integration planning
- **Backward compatibility verification** for regression safety
- Full integration with **ComponentRegistry** and **FeatureRegistry**
- Comprehensive **integration test coverage** (see `/tests/integration/registry/test_dependency_impact_analysis.py`)

It is architected to be auditable, extensible, and protocol-compliant as per all AeroLearn system and TDD instructions.

## 2. API and Architecture

### 2.1. ComponentRegistry Extensions

- `detect_api_change(component_id)`  
  Detects if the API/version for a component has changed, returning `(changed: bool, details: dict)`.

- `analyze_dependency_impact(component_id)`  
  Returns a list of components (by name) that are transitively dependent on the component.

- `calculate_compatibility_risk(component_id)`  
  Returns a risk score (float) and a breakdown of as-risk components.

- `check_version_compatibility(component_id)`  
  Returns True if the component version is backward compatible (as per simple heuristic).

### 2.2. FeatureRegistry Extensions

- `register_feature(name, component, status)`  
  Registers a new feature, linking it to its supplied component.

- `link_feature_dependency(feature_name, dependency_name)`  
  Adds a dependency relationship at the feature level.

- `analyze_feature_impact_from_component_change(component_name, component_registry)`  
  Returns all features potentially impacted by changes to the given component.

- `check_feature_backward_compatibility(feature_name, component_registry)`  
  Returns True if the supplied feature remains fully backward compatible with all its dependencies.

- `feature_compatibility_risk(feature_name, component_registry)`  
  Returns a risk score and breakdown for a feature, accounting for all component and feature-level impacts.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1. Impact & Risk Modeling

- **Impact propagation** uses transitive closure over both component and feature dependency graphs.
- **Compatibility risk** scoring aggregates both versioning heuristics and system topology awareness.
- **Change detection** is tied to version identifiers, using heuristics that can be customized.

### 3.2. Test-Driven Development

- All core API contracts are established and validated in `/tests/integration/registry/test_dependency_impact_analysis.py`.
- Tests include:
  - Version bump detection, propagation, and impact reporting 
  - Feature and component graph traversal
  - Risk scoring for topological and semantic system changes
  - End-to-end coverage from isolated API to integrated feature workflows

---

## 4. Usage Example

```python
from integrations.registry.component_registry import ComponentRegistry
from app.core.project_management.feature_tracker import FeatureRegistry

# ... (see test_dependency_impact_analysis.py for full workflow) ...
```

---

## 5. Extension and Limitations

- **Extensible:** API contracts are stable; algorithmic enhancements (smarter diffing, semantic scoring, UI Dashboard integration) can be developed with no breaking change.
- **Known Limitations:** Current risk/compatibility logic is heuristic and may require domain extensions for production-safety in high-stakes migrations.
