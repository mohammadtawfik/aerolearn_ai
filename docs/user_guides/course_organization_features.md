# User Guide: Course Organization Features

Welcome to the AeroLearn AI system's advanced course structure and organization features! This guide will help you efficiently organize, categorize, and find learning content.

---

## 1. Course Structure Editing

- **Drag-and-drop modules and lessons** within the course organizer.
- **Reorder** content by dragging entries to desired positions.
- **Add prerequisites** by selecting one or more courses/modules that must be completed first.

---

## 2. Categorizing Content

- Use the **Category Multi-Select** interface to assign one or more categories to a course, module, or lesson.
- Categories are hierarchical: select parent or child categories as needed.
- Categories standardize how content is grouped and found.

---

## 3. Tagging Content

- Tags are keywords you can assign freely (e.g., "python", "data-science").
- Use the **Tag Autocomplete** UI to add or remove tags.
- Tags help users search and filter for the precise content they need.

---

## 4. Automated Suggestions

- The system may recommend categories/tags based on content.
- Accept or adjust these as desired to improve discoverability.

---

## 5. Searching & Filtering Content

- Use the **Filter/Search Bar** to quickly locate courses, modules, or lessons by category or tag.
- Enter a category and/or tag and press "Search" to display matching items.
- You can combine both for narrow results.

---

## 6. Propagation & Consistency

- When categories/tags change, updates propagate across search interfaces and lists.
- Removing a category/tag instantly updates all relevant menus and filters.

---

## 7. Advanced Topics

- You can bulk edit categories/tags from the admin interface.
- REST API endpoints are available for automation (see API docs).
