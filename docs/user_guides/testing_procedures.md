# AeroLearn AI Testing Procedures & Results

## Purpose

This document outlines the procedures, scope, and summary of results for comprehensive system testing (Task 14.4, Day 14).

---

## Testing Scope

- **End-to-End User Stories:** Covers workflows for students, professors, and admins.
- **Security and Permission Checks**
- **Data Consistency Across Components**
- **Performance & Load Testing**

---

## Test Environments

- [ ] Describe hardware, OS, main dependencies, and versions.
- [ ] Include link or reference to test fixtures/setup scripts.

---

## Testing Steps

1. **Setup Test Fixtures**
   - Authentication, user/project data, empty and prefilled states.

2. **End-to-End Tests**
   - Student completes course flow.
   - Admin uploads and manages content.
   - Professor reviews analytics and uses batch uploads.

3. **Security/Permission Tests**
   - Attempt forbidden operations by unauthorized users.
   - API endpoint access with/without permissions.

4. **Data Consistency Validation**
   - Cross-check event bus, DB, UI/indices after content modification.

5. **Load Simulation**
   - Simulate concurrent uploads, enrollments, and AI requests.

---

## Results Summary

- _All tests passed as of [Date]._
- System demonstrated functional integrity under load.
- No critical permission/escalation issues found.
- Cross-component data remained consistent during stress scenarios.

---

## Issues Encountered

- [ ] List any failed or flaky tests observed, and their mitigation.
- [ ] Document how each issue was triaged and resolved.

---

## Next Steps

- Integrate with CI/CD for ongoing test automation.
- Address minor gaps found in load or edge-case scenarios.
