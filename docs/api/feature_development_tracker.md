# Feature Development Tracker â€“ API & Usage Documentation

**Location:** `/app/core/project_management/feature_tracker.py`  
**Docs:** `/docs/api/feature_development_tracker.md`  
**Status:** Complete and protocol-compliant (as of Day 20 TDD cycle)

---

## Purpose

The Feature Development Tracker provides a protocol-compliant registry and management system for project features.  
It supports:
- Feature registration (with mapped components)
- Status and progress tracking (enum/status history)
- Dependency graph and cross-feature linkage
- Protocol-ready APIs for use in dashboards, impact analysis, and end-to-end audits

---

## API Overview

### FeatureStatus Enum

```python
class FeatureStatus(Enum):
    PLANNED
    IN_PROGRESS
    COMPLETED
    BLOCKED
    ON_HOLD
    CANCELLED
```

---

### Feature Dataclass

```python
@dataclass
class Feature:
    name: str
    component: str
    status: FeatureStatus = FeatureStatus.PLANNED
    dependencies: Set[str] = field(default_factory=set)
    status_history: List[StatusHistoryRecord] = field(default_factory=list)

    def update_status(self, new_status: FeatureStatus):
        ...
```

---

### FeatureRegistry Class

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `register_feature(name, component, status="PLANNED")` | Register new feature, initial status/component mapping |
| `get_feature(name)` | Retrieve registered feature details |
| `update_feature_status(name, new_status)` | Set feature status, append audit history |
| `link_feature_dependency(feature_name, dependency_name)` | Add dependency between features, cyclic/invalid protection |
| `get_feature_dependency_graph()` | Returns `{feature: [dependencies...]}` dict |
| `get_status_history(name)` | Retrieve status/audit history for a feature |

#### Cycle Prevention
- Linking a feature as dependent on itself or creating a dependency cycle returns `False`, in accordance with dependency protocol.

#### Status Propagation
- For advanced use (planned extension), registry supports methods for status-aware propagation across the graph.

## Usage Example

```python
from app.core.project_management.feature_tracker import FeatureRegistry

reg = FeatureRegistry()
reg.register_feature("Quiz Engine Rewrite", component="QuizService", status="PLANNED")
reg.register_feature("Feedback Refactor", component="FeedbackService", status="PLANNED")
reg.link_feature_dependency("Feedback Refactor", "Quiz Engine Rewrite")
reg.update_feature_status("Quiz Engine Rewrite", "COMPLETED")

# Get dependency graph
print(reg.get_feature_dependency_graph())
# Get status history for review/audit
print(reg.get_status_history("Quiz Engine Rewrite"))
```

---

## Protocol Compliance

- **Registry design** aligns with `/docs/architecture/dependency_tracking_protocol.md`
- **Status enums/history** mirror registry, monitoring, and audit practices in `/docs/architecture/service_health_protocol.md`
- **API ready for extension** with milestones/resources (see future day20 tasks)
- **Audit-proof**: All status transitions timestamped and retrievable

---

## Extension & Integration

- Ready for dashboard/UI/state monitoring integration
- Extendable for milestone/resource tracking via a similar API
- Designed for test-driven workflows, matches locations/requirements in `/docs/development/day20_plan.md` and `/code_summary.md`
