# AeroLearn AI â€” Tagging System API

## Overview

Tags are flexible, persistent labels used for searching, filtering, and recommendation across all course, module, and lesson content.

## Data Model

- See `/app/models/tag.py` for the Tag model, with many-to-many links to Course, Module, and Lesson.
- Tags are deduplicated and global.

## Assignment Flow

- Tags may be created at assignment time or from a managed vocabulary.
- Tags can be added/removed via UI (autocomplete), API, or direct DB operations.
- Supported from all editors: course, module, lesson.

## Tag Search & Filtering

Backend search utility (`/app/models/tag_search.py`):

- **search_courses_by_tag(session, tag_name):**  
  Fetch all Course objects tagged with `tag_name` (case-insensitive).
- **search_lessons_by_tag(session, tag_name):**  
  Fetch all Lesson objects tagged with `tag_name`.
- **search_courses_by_tag_partial(session, fragment):**  
  Fetch all Courses that have tags containing `fragment`.

## Usage Example (Python, backend):
```python
from app.models.tag_search import search_courses_by_tag

courses = search_courses_by_tag(db_session, "graph theory")
```

## Extending

- Supports integration with AI-powered suggestion (see `/app/models/tag_suggestion.py`).
- Can be surfaced to REST/GraphQL API for use in web/mobile clients.
