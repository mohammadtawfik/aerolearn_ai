## Implementation Plan for Day 11

Each task aligns with the above checklist. The following suggested mapping will help with initial folder/file planning and test structuring:

| Task          | Main Implementation Files/Locations                        | Test Directory/Files                          | Documentation                                    |

**Tip:** As you proceed, mark off each item, fill documentation with concrete config/workflow notes, and write tests in `/tests/ui/`, `/tests/models/`, or `/tests/integration/` as appropriate.
