## Implementation Plan for Day 11

Each task aligns with the above checklist. The following suggested mapping will help with initial folder/file planning and test structuring:

| Task          | Main Implementation Files/Locations                        | Test Directory/Files                          | Documentation                                    |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 11.1          | `/app/ui/admin/`, `/app/core/auth/`, `/app/models/user.py` | `/tests/ui/test_admin_auth.py`<br>`/tests/models/test_permissions.py` | `/docs/architecture/admin_security.md`<br>`/docs/user_guides/admin_auth.md` |
| 11.2          | `/app/ui/admin/user_management.py`<br>`/app/core/auth/user_profile.py` | `/tests/ui/test_user_management.py`<br>`/tests/models/test_user_ops.py` | `/docs/api/user_management_api.md`<br>`/docs/user_guides/admin_user_mgmt.md` |

**Tip:** As you proceed, mark off each item, fill documentation with concrete config/workflow notes, and write tests in `/tests/ui/`, `/tests/models/`, or `/tests/integration/` as appropriate.
