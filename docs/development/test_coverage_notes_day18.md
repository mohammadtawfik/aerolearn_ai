# Day 18: Test Strategy & Coverage Notes

**Location:** `/docs/development/test_coverage_notes_day18.md`

## Approach

- All feature work for Day 18 proceeded TDD-first.
- Each new pipeline component added only after tests for it were in place.

## Entry Points

| Test Name | Scope |
|-----------|-------|
| `test_full_progress_to_intervention_pipeline` | Integration: raw data â†’ intervention |
| `test_cross_component_data_aggregation`      | System: cross-model aggregation       |
| `test_intervention_trigger_accuracy`         | Functional: analytics-driven triggers |
| `test_data_persistence_and_retrieval`        | Services: metric/analytics storage    |

## Extension

- Add more student scenarios by introducing mock records and patterns in integration/unit tests.
- To test new aggregation axes, update `aggregate_learning_data` and mirror in new test cases.
- All milestone changes listed in `/docs/development/day18_changelog.md`.
