# Advanced AI Integration Workflows

*This document accompanies Task 13.4 (see `/docs/development/day13_plan.md`) and outlines the advanced integration testing workflows, scenarios, and validation criteria for AeroLearn AI's semantic search, content relationship mapping, and external resource discovery.*

---

## Overview

Integration testing is the final step that validates not just isolated modules, but end-to-end workflows that span semantic search, relationship mapping, and the discovery of external resources relevant to the learning context. This ensures reliability and "real-world" behavior for complex user and AI-driven scenarios.

## Test Setup

- **Sample Content:** See `/tests/fixtures/sample_content.py` for in-memory or fixture-based course/module/lesson objects used in tests.
- **Mocked and Real Providers:** External resource discovery uses both internal logic and mocked API provider classes to simulate real usage and edge cases.
- **Permission Environment:** Hybrid search and content interaction always run "as" a specific user, exercising permission boundaries via `/app/core/auth/authorization.py`.

## Scenarios Tested

### 1. Semantic Search Integration

- Tests across multiple repositories, varying user permissions, mixed query types.
- Validates:
  - Accurate result aggregation from keyword + semantic backends
  - Correct permission-based filtering
  - Deduplication and result ranking with relevance metrics
  - Edge cases (e.g., ambiguous queries, empty input)

### 2. Relationship Mapping & Knowledge Graph

- Full flow: extraction of concepts from mixed content, building/visualizing knowledge graphs, recommendations.
- Validates:
  - Correct extraction and mapping of cross-content concepts
  - Detection and labeling of relationships (prerequisite, related, etc.)
  - Navigation and recommendation flows with relationship-based traversal
  - Knowledge graph export to DOT for visualization/debugging

### 3. External Resource Discovery

- Integrates content context, multiple providers, scoring, filtering, and deduplication logic.
- Validates:
  - End-to-end flow: content → provider(s) → score/filter/rank → results
  - No duplicate resources, correct metadata fields, quality labels
  - Seamless behavior on rare/edge content, robust handling of "no match" scenarios

## Metrics and Results Reporting

- Each test asserts both functional correctness (output type, content, rank order) and metrics (coverage, minimum expected results, pass/fail by criteria).
- Recommend collecting and reporting:
  - Total integration coverage (content types, edge scenarios)
  - Resource and result diversity
  - Real vs. expected permission filtering
  - Recommendation path lengths and accuracy metrics
  - Quality and relevance scores distribution

## Contribution Guidelines

- When adding or updating tests, always place new integration tests under `/tests/integration/`.
- Any new workflow/scenario should be described and documented here and referenced in `/docs/development/day13_plan.md`.
- Code and documentation should remain tightly coupled; update test descriptions as scenarios expand.
