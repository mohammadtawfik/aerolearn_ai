> ⚠️ **DEVELOPER WARNING – ENVIRONMENT & IMPORT ERRORS** ⚠️  
>
> Recent project history exposed two recurring mistakes that waste developer time and break tests/envs:
>
> **1. Environment Packages:**  
> - **Never install `pytest-qt`, `PyQt6`, `PyQt5`, `PySide6`, or `PySide2` in the project venv unless specifically developing/testing a Qt UI feature.**
> - Their presence can corrupt all test runs with DLL import errors, even if you aren't writing GUI code.
> - Use a separate venv for Qt or GUI work. Document and announce this before merging.
>
> **2. Import Hygiene:**  
> - **Always confirm where models/classes are defined before importing.**
> - E.g., the `Answer` class lives in `app/models/assessment.py`. Importing it from anywhere else causes project-breaking ImportErrors.
> - Use code search or consult `code_summary.md` before changing deep imports.
>
> **Mistakes here create major delays for all. Read this before beginning Day 17–31 work.**

---

#### Daily Notes (Day 20 Update)
- **Documentation generator fully implemented and integrated.**
- All tests (unit and integration) for doc generation passed per TDD requirements.
- `/app/tools/doc_generator.py` (generator logic) and `/docs/generated/` outputs are in sync and compliance with plan and protocol documentation.
- No missing documentation flagged in current output; see `/docs/generated/index.md` for real-time audit.
- Project tracking for Day 20 is complete—ready to advance to next sprint goal or planned task (see next plan).
