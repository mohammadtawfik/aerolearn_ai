> ⚠️ **DEVELOPER WARNING – ENVIRONMENT & IMPORT ERRORS** ⚠️  
>
> Recent project history exposed two recurring mistakes that waste developer time and break tests/envs:
>
> **1. Environment Packages:**  
> - **Never install `pytest-qt`, `PyQt6`, `PyQt5`, `PySide6`, or `PySide2` in the project venv unless specifically developing/testing a Qt UI feature.**
> - Their presence can corrupt all test runs with DLL import errors, even if you aren't writing GUI code.
> - Use a separate venv for Qt or GUI work. Document and announce this before merging.
>
> **2. Import Hygiene:**  
> - **Always confirm where models/classes are defined before importing.**
> - E.g., the `Answer` class lives in `app/models/assessment.py`. Importing it from anywhere else causes project-breaking ImportErrors.
> - Use code search or consult `code_summary.md` before changing deep imports.
>
> **Mistakes here create major delays for all. Read this before beginning Day 17–31 work.**

## TDD-Driven Workflow Requirement

- **Tests written first for all registry and dependency logic; new/updated features must target the correct module and use only the modular interface. No legacy monolith logic may be added or used.**
- **All modular and protocol tests must pass before any merge or deployment.**
- **Migratory touchpoints have been updated (tests, adapters, dashboards).**
- **Test and implementation coverage is enforced as per the documented audit process.**

---

#### Daily Notes
- 4.1.1-4.1.2: **Framework and integration protocols validated and delivered**
- 4.1.3: **Registry modularization completed** - critical for maintainability and future extensions
- Health dashboards/adapters: `clear()` method in place and required for all test suites
- All integration test patterns documented (see `/docs/development/integration_test_patterns.md`)
- **NEXT**: Begin Task 4.1.4—UI testing automation.

## Milestone Achieved (TODAY)

- TDD: Protocol-compliant initialization, status, dependency, and cascading support API for `ServiceHealthDashboard` **implemented and tested**.
- Dashboard now integrates exclusively via dependency-injected registry and exposes required API for cascading.
- **Registry modularization complete** with clean separation of concerns:
  - Component entity definition
  - Dependency graph logic
  - Registry orchestration layer
  - Clean public API
- ✅ **Registry and dependency graph protocol-compliant modularization implemented and tested.**
- ✅ **All protocol-required modular tests passed.**
- ✅ **Documentation and project code summary updated for protocol compliance (see `/code_summary.md`, `/docs/architecture/architecture_overview.md`, `/docs/architecture/dependency_tracking_protocol.md`).**

## Next Steps

- **Required:** All future component/dependency-related features must use the modular interface, not legacy monoliths
- **Optional:** Implement true cascading logic (propagate dependency status failures to all dependents recursively) per protocol for next milestone/test push.
- **Maintain**: Keep protocol tests updated for any further interface/surface changes.
- **Verify documentation and API coverage** in [service_health_protocol.md] and [dependency_tracking_protocol.md] for any further surface.
- **Update**: Ensure `/code_summary.md`, `/docs/architecture/architecture_overview.md`, and `/docs/doc_index.md` reflect new structure

---

## Integration Test Modularization (COMPLETED)

As part of ongoing maintainability and TDD practice, the registry/component protocol test suite is now split into focused modules:

- `/tests/integration/registry/test_component_registry_registration.py` - Component registration and lookup
- `/tests/integration/registry/test_component_registry_lifecycle.py` - Component status transitions and events
- `/tests/integration/registry/test_component_registry_dependency.py` - Dependency tracking and cascading

This replaces the monolithic `/tests/integration/test_component_registry.py` enforceable from this development cycle forward.

### Testing Guidelines

- **All new/updated protocol or registry features must have coverage in the most relevant single-purpose test file.**
- **All team members should reference both `code_summary.md` and `doc_index.md` for up-to-date test suite structure.**
- **TDD workflow must be followed:** write tests in the appropriate modular test file before implementing features.
- **Test isolation:** Each test module should focus only on its specific aspect of the registry protocol.

# Testing and Verification (Protocol Compliance)

## Mandatory TDD and Modular Test Checklist

This checklist codifies the required TDD-first, protocol-driven test/development practice for all registry, dependency, and health/status interfaces—effective immediately for all team members and contributions.

### 1. Test-Driven Development (TDD) is MANDATORY

- All new features or changes **MUST begin with new or updated modular tests**.
- No protocol code or implementation changes may be merged until matching modular test(s) exist and pass.

### 2. Modular Test File Location and Structure

- **No monolithic or legacy registry/integration tests allowed.**
    - Each protocol/API surface (e.g., registration, dependency tracking, dashboard operations, status adapters) must have its own dedicated test module under:
      - `/tests/integration/registry/` (for registry and dependency graph integration)
      - `/tests/unit/core/monitoring/` (for dashboard/component status/health logic)
- Required files (all implemented and passing):
    - `/tests/integration/registry/test_component_registry_registration.py`
    - `/tests/integration/registry/test_component_registry_lifecycle.py`
    - `/tests/integration/registry/test_component_registry_dependency.py`

### 3. Exact Testing Requirements

- **Registration/Component Protocol**:
    - Registration must prove correct ID/storage, rejection of duplicates, and full test isolation.
    - Use only the public API—never instantiate or manage components/graphs directly in tests except for those classes' own unit tests.
- **Dependency Tracking Protocol**:
    - All add, remove, query, and analytic methods must be tested for protocol compliance and order guarantees.
    - Cycle detection and analytic behavior must be covered (see `/tests/integration/registry/test_dependency_tracking.py`).
- **ComponentState Enum Source**:
    - All state and status tests must import the enum strictly from `/integrations/registry/component_state.py`.
- **Test Isolation and Repeatability**:
    - Each modular test file/setup must ensure isolation—no cross-file or global state.
    - No side effects from one test to another are permitted.
- **Coverage Enforcement**:
    - Every test related to protocol features must be referenced by filename in review and continuous integration checklists.

### 4. Documentation, Review, and Audit

- Any new feature or protocol-surface change **must update documentation** (including this checklist/plan and key summary docs) as soon as new modular test files are added.
- All review/merge requests should reference the exact modular test file(s) covering the protocol, and MUST attach a passing CI/test report.
- Audit logs or code review notes should include which test modules verify each protocol surface.

### Mandatory TDD and Modular Test Checklist

- [x] Modular test coverage verified for:
    - `/tests/integration/registry/test_component_registry_registration.py`
    - `/tests/integration/registry/test_component_registry_lifecycle.py`
    - `/tests/integration/registry/test_component_registry_dependency.py`
- [x] Implementation fully modular, code synchronized to docs, protocols enforced.
