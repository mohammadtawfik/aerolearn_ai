# Day 13: Advanced AI Analysis — Plan, Criteria, and Implementation Map

**Status as of 2024-06-09:**  
☑ **Task 13.1:** Complete *(see deliverables below)*  
☑ **Task 13.2:** Complete  
☑ **Task 13.3:** Complete  
▢ **Task 13.4:** Not started

## Summary of Progress

- **Task 13.3 is now fully complete:**  
  - All code and documentation requirements for external resource discovery are met.
  - Modular resource orchestrator and manager implemented, with providers (DeepSeek example), scoring, and integration logic.
  - Comprehensive and extensible plugin architecture for resource discovery providers.
  - Robust test coverage for core AI orchestrator, provider integration, scoring, and error handling.
  - Documentation for API, usage, extension, and CI setup is present.
  - User/developer guides provided for onboarding, integration, and troubleshooting.

- **Key Learnings:**  
  - Secure, modular integration of external AI-driven resources can be achieved by abstracting provider logic and scoring.
  - Detailed test coverage combined with explicit, discoverable config management ensures reliability and onboarding efficiency.
  - Documentation at every delivery step boosts team alignment and future extensibility.

- **Test Health:**  
  - All integration and unit tests for resource discovery, provider API integration, and relevance scoring now pass.
  - Docs, CI, and implementation are synchronized.
  - All previous reported module import issues are fixed.

## ❏ Task 13.1: Implement Semantic Search System

- [x] Create component-specific search targets with permission filtering
- [x] Implement hybrid search combining keyword and semantic approaches
- [x] Develop relevance scoring algorithms with customization
- [x] Add search result aggregation with deduplication
- [x] Write unit tests for search accuracy and relevance ranking
- [x] Document search API and relevance tuning options

**Deliverables:**
- Core code:
  - `/app/core/ai/semantic_search.py` (hybrid search orchestrator)
  - `/app/core/search/semantic_backend.py` (semantic backend, already implemented)
- Tests:

### Sprint Review Instructions

- Reviewers must confirm checklist completion and the presence of code, tests, and docs in the mapped locations for each subtask.
- For each subtask, ensure API, workflows, and architectural documentation are complete.

## Next Steps

1. Continue to Task 13.4: Advanced AI Integration Testing.
2. Review onboarding/documentation for accuracy as future contributors reference these files.
3. Retrospective: capture any lessons learned and outline future enhancements for the resource discovery/relationship mapping subsystem (expand plugin providers, add ML-based scoring, support additional formats/APIs, etc.).

## Changelog

- [COMPLETE] **Task 13.3:** All requirements for external resource discovery are now complete, including code, tests, and documentation.
- [DOCS] **This plan** now reflects the completed status of Task 13.3 and outlines next steps for Task 13.4.
