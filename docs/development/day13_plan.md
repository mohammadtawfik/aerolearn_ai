# Day 13: Advanced AI Analysis — Plan, Criteria, and Implementation Map

**Status as of 2024-06-09:**  
☑ **Task 13.1:** Complete *(see deliverables below)*  
☑ **Task 13.2:** Complete  
☑ **Task 13.3:** Complete  
☑ **Task 13.4:** Complete

## Summary of Progress

- **Task 13.4 is now fully complete:**  
  - All integration tests for semantic search, relationship mapping, and external resource discovery are implemented and verified as passing.
  - Documentation deliverables, including this plan and the Advanced AI Integration Workflows user guide, have been authored and committed.
  - Coverage includes strict relevance metrics, multi-repository content, and cross-module event flow.
  - Test workflows have been validated in both development and CI environments.

- **Key Learnings:**  
  - Secure, modular integration of external AI-driven resources can be achieved by abstracting provider logic and scoring.
  - Detailed test coverage combined with explicit, discoverable config management ensures reliability and onboarding efficiency.
  - Documentation at every delivery step boosts team alignment and future extensibility.
  - Cross-module integration testing reveals edge cases that unit tests miss, particularly in AI relevance scoring.

- **Test Health:**  
  - All integration and unit tests for resource discovery, provider API integration, and relevance scoring now pass.
  - Docs, CI, and implementation are synchronized.
  - All previous reported module import issues are fixed.
  - End-to-end workflows validated across all AI subsystems.

## ❏ Task 13.1: Implement Semantic Search System

- [x] Create component-specific search targets with permission filtering
- [x] Implement hybrid search combining keyword and semantic approaches
- [x] Develop relevance scoring algorithms with customization
- [x] Add search result aggregation with deduplication
- [x] Write unit tests for search accuracy and relevance ranking
- [x] Document search API and relevance tuning options

**Deliverables:**
- Core code:
  - `/app/core/ai/semantic_search.py` (hybrid search orchestrator)
  - `/app/core/search/semantic_backend.py` (semantic backend, already implemented)
- Tests:
  - `/tests/core/ai/test_semantic_search.py` (unit coverage for all major features)
  - `/tests/core/search/` (existing/classic search tests)
- Documentation:
  - `/docs/api/search_api.md` (API reference/spec)
  - `/docs/user_guides/semantic_search.md` (user & admin guide)

*Review instructions:*
- All deliverables are in place and mapped as above.  
- See `/docs/api/search_api.md` and `/docs/user_guides/semantic_search.md` for workflow, API and tuning details.
