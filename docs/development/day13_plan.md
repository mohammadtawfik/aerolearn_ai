# Day 13: Advanced AI Analysis — Plan, Criteria, and Implementation Map

**Status as of 2023-11-17:**  
☑ **Task 13.1:** Complete *(see deliverables below)*  
☑ **Task 13.2:** Complete  
▢ **Task 13.3:** Not started  
▢ **Task 13.4:** Not started

## Summary of Progress

- **Task 13.2 is now fully complete:**  
  - All code and documentation requirements for content relationship mapping are met.
  - Concept extraction is robust (supports singular/plural/compound/accented forms).
  - Comprehensive relationship mapping from content to concepts ("covers") is established.
  - KnowledgeGraph construction, navigation, and DOT export are fully implemented, documented, and demonstrated via example scripts and guides.
  - User/developer documentation is present for construction, relationship types, visualization, and recommendations.
  - Test coverage ensures accurate extraction and relationship creation, with integration tested and robust.
  
- **Key Learnings:**  
  - Concept extraction and relationship mapping require not only code but practical workflows and documentation to ensure reproducibility and onboarding.
  - Integration between knowledge graph components, visualization, and navigation is well understood and extensible.

- **Test Health:**  
  - All integration and unit tests for relationship mapping now pass.
  - Documentation and CI are in sync with implementation.

## ❏ Task 13.1: Implement Semantic Search System

- [x] Create component-specific search targets with permission filtering
- [x] Implement hybrid search combining keyword and semantic approaches
- [x] Develop relevance scoring algorithms with customization
- [x] Add search result aggregation with deduplication
- [x] Write unit tests for search accuracy and relevance ranking
- [x] Document search API and relevance tuning options

**Deliverables:**
- Core code:
  - `/app/core/ai/semantic_search.py` (hybrid search orchestrator)
  - `/app/core/search/semantic_backend.py` (semantic backend, already implemented)
- Tests:
  - `/tests/core/ai/test_semantic_search.py` (unit coverage for all major features)
  - `/tests/core/search/` (existing/classic search tests)
- Documentation:
  - `/docs/api/search_api.md` (API reference/spec)
  - `/docs/user_guides/semantic_search.md` (user & admin guide)

*Review instructions:*
- All deliverables are in place and mapped as above.  
- See `/docs/api/search_api.md` and `/docs/user_guides/semantic_search.md` for workflow, API and tuning details.

### Sprint Review Instructions

- Reviewers must confirm checklist completion and the presence of code, tests, and docs in the mapped locations for each subtask.
- For each subtask, ensure API, workflows, and architectural documentation are complete.

## Next Steps

1. Continue to Task 13.3: External Resource Discovery.
2. Review onboarding/documentation for accuracy as future contributors reference these files.
3. Retrospective: capture any lessons learned and outline future enhancements for knowledge graph/relationship mapping (multi-lingual, synonym, or advanced relationship types).

---

## Changelog

- [COMPLETE] **Task 13.2:** All requirements for content relationship mapping are now complete, including code, tests, and documentation.
- [DOCS] **This plan** now reflects the completed status of Task 13.2 and outlines next steps for Task 13.3.
