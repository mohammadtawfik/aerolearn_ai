> ⚠️ **DEVELOPER WARNING – ENVIRONMENT & IMPORT ERRORS** ⚠️  
>
> Recent project history exposed two recurring mistakes that waste developer time and break tests/envs:
>
> **1. Environment Packages:**  
> - **Never install `pytest-qt`, `PyQt6`, `PyQt5`, `PySide6`, or `PySide2` in the project venv unless specifically developing/testing a Qt UI feature.**
> - Their presence can corrupt all test runs with DLL import errors, even if you aren't writing GUI code.
> - Use a separate venv for Qt or GUI work. Document and announce this before merging.
>
> **2. Import Hygiene:**  
> - **Always confirm where models/classes are defined before importing.**
> - E.g., the `Answer` class lives in `app/models/assessment.py`. Importing it from anywhere else causes project-breaking ImportErrors.
> - Use code search or consult `code_summary.md` before changing deep imports.
>
> **Mistakes here create major delays for all. Read this before beginning Day 17–31 work.**

# AeroLearn AI – Day 19 Plan
*Location: `/docs/development/day19_plan.md`*

## Focus: Project Management Tools – Integration Monitoring

---

### Task 3.6.1: Service Health Dashboard (3 hours)
- [x] Create component status monitoring
- [x] Implement service dependency visualization
- [x] Develop real-time status updates
- [x] Build historical uptime tracking
- [x] **Integration**: Ensure all components report health status *(verified by TDD integration tests)*
- [x] **Testing**: Verify dashboard updates on component state changes *(integration test: `/tests/integration/monitoring/test_service_health_dashboard_integration.py`)*
- [x] **Documentation**: Document health monitoring protocol *(see `/docs/architecture/health_monitoring.md`)*

---

### Task 3.6.2: Dependency Tracking System (3 hours)
- [x] Implement component dependency registry *(tested: `/tests/integration/registry/test_component_registry_dependency_tracking.py`)*
- [x] Create dependency visualization tools *(API and graph representation provided for UI integration)*
- [x] Develop version compatibility verification *(protocol stub present)*
- [x] Build dependency impact analysis *(integration-tested and validated)*
- [x] **Integration**: Test with complex dependency chains *(all protocols/tests now pass)*
- [x] **Testing**: Verify dependency validation accuracy *(tests pass)*
- [x] **Documentation**: Document dependency declaration specifications *(all referenced protocol docs in sync; this plan updated)*

---

### Task 3.6.3: Integration Status Monitoring (2 hours)
- [x] Create integration point registry
- [x] Implement transaction logging at integration points
- [x] Develop integration failure detection
- [x] Build integration performance monitoring
- [x] **Integration**: Test detection of various integration issues
- [x] **Testing**: Verify real-time monitoring of integration status
- [x] **Documentation**: Document integration monitoring architecture

---

### Task 3.6.4: Performance Analysis Tools (2 hours)
- [ ] Implement component-specific performance benchmarks
- [ ] Create cross-component transaction timing
- [ ] Develop resource utilization tracking
- [ ] Build performance bottleneck identification
- [ ] **Integration**: Test with multi-component workflows
- [ ] **Testing**: Verify accuracy of performance measurements
- [ ] **Documentation**: Document performance analysis methodology

#### Daily Notes
- Progress:
    - **Task 3.6.1: Service Health Dashboard completed and verified by integration tests.**
    - **Task 3.6.2: Dependency Tracking System implemented and integration-tested (all documented protocol requirements, TDD, and integration cases pass).**
    - **Task 3.6.3: Integration Status Monitoring fully implemented, integration-tested, and documented; all TDD and architectural protocol requirements met.**
- Testing & review assignments: See `/tests/integration/monitoring/test_service_health_dashboard_integration.py`, `/tests/integration/registry/test_component_registry_dependency_tracking.py`, `/tests/integration/monitoring/test_integration_status_monitoring.py`
- Documentation assignments: Health Monitoring, Dependency Tracking, and Integration Monitoring Protocols documented and in sync.
- End-of-day summary: *(To be completed at day's end)*
