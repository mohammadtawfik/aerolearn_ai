> ⚠️ **DEVELOPER WARNING – ENVIRONMENT & IMPORT ERRORS** ⚠️  
>
> Recent project history exposed two recurring mistakes that waste developer time and break tests/envs:
>
> **1. Environment Packages:**  
> - **Never install `pytest-qt`, `PyQt6`, `PyQt5`, `PySide6`, or `PySide2` in the project venv unless specifically developing/testing a Qt UI feature.**
> - Their presence can corrupt all test runs with DLL import errors, even if you aren't writing GUI code.
> - Use a separate venv for Qt or GUI work. Document and announce this before merging.
>
> **2. Import Hygiene:**  
> - **Always confirm where models/classes are defined before importing.**
> - E.g., the `Answer` class lives in `app/models/assessment.py`. Importing it from anywhere else causes project-breaking ImportErrors.
> - Use code search or consult `code_summary.md` before changing deep imports.
>
> **Mistakes here create major delays for all. Read this before beginning Day 17–31 work.**

# AeroLearn AI – Day 19 Plan
*Location: `/docs/development/day19_plan.md`*

## Focus: Project Management Tools – Integration Monitoring

---

### Task 3.6.1: Service Health Dashboard (3 hours)
- [x] Create component status monitoring
- [x] Implement service dependency visualization
- [x] Develop real-time status updates
- [x] Build historical uptime tracking
- [x] **Integration**: Ensure all components report health status *(integration tests passed)*
- [x] **Testing**: Verify dashboard updates on component state changes *(integration test: `/tests/integration/monitoring/test_service_health_dashboard_integration.py`)*
- [x] **Documentation**: Health monitoring protocol **documented and in sync**.

---

### Task 3.6.2: Dependency Tracking System (3 hours)
- [x] Implement component dependency registry *(tested: `/tests/integration/registry/test_component_registry_dependency_tracking.py`)*
- [x] Create dependency visualization tools *(API and graph representation provided for UI integration)*
- [x] Develop version compatibility verification *(protocol stub present)*
- [x] Build dependency impact analysis *(integration-tested, validated, and documented)*
- [x] **Integration**: Complex dependency chains *tested and passed*.
- [x] **Testing**: Dependency validation tests *all pass*.
- [x] **Documentation**: Dependency declaration and protocol docs updated as required.

---

### Task 3.6.3: Integration Status Monitoring (2 hours)
- [x] Create integration point registry
- [x] Implement transaction logging at integration points
- [x] Develop integration failure detection
- [x] Build integration performance monitoring
- [x] **Integration**: Integration issues detected and visualized
- [x] **Testing**: Real-time integration monitoring *tests pass*
- [x] **Documentation**: Monitoring architecture protocol *verified and documented*.

---

### Task 3.6.4: Performance Analysis Tools (2 hours)
- [x] Implement component-specific performance benchmarks
- [x] Create cross-component transaction timing
- [x] Develop resource utilization tracking
- [x] Build performance bottleneck identification
- [x] **Integration**: Multi-component workflow tests *pass* (`/tests/integration/monitoring/test_performance_analysis.py`)
- [x] **Testing**: All integration and performance measurement tests *pass* (TDD)
- [x] **Documentation**:
    - Protocol and API *verified in* `/docs/architecture/service_health_protocol.md`
    - Performance analyzer implementation *fully compliant*
- [x] **Result**: Task fully implemented and tested; documentation and protocol alignment confirmed.

---

#### Daily Notes
- **Progress**: All Task 3.6.x features TDD'd, implemented, tested, and documented.
- **Testing & review** assignments complete.
- **Documentation assignments** updated and all protocol docs in sync.
- **Ready for Day 20 work**: Next sprint will begin with test-first development for Day 20 plan.

- **End-of-day summary**: *Milestone achieved, regression passing, all architecture/protocol docs validated. No outstanding technical debt for Tasks 3.6.x.*
