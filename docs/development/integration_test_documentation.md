# AeroLearn AI â€“ Weekly Integration Testing (Task 3.8.1)

**File:** `/docs/development/integration_test_documentation.md`  
**Last Update:** (Day 21 cycle)

---

## Summary

Integration tests were implemented, executed, and now pass for all Day 21 requirements as outlined in `/docs/development/day21_plan.md` for Task 3.8.1:

- **Student System to Content Repo:** Verified that students can retrieve course and content listings via the documented DBClient interface.
- **Progress Tracking to Analytics:** Progress events recorded in ProgressMetrics are reflected in AnalyticsEngine with strict protocol compliance.
- **Authentication Flow:** End-to-end login/session/permission checks pass using the documented Authenticator.
- **Cross-Component Consistency:** Enrollment and progress state are consistent between DBClient, metrics, and analytics engines.
- **Service Component Health Monitoring:** All test components (`Auth`, `DB`, `ProgressAnalyticsEngine`) are registered and visible in the ComponentRegistry and ServiceHealthDashboard.

## Test Locations

- `/tests/integration/test_weekly_integration_workflows.py`

## Outcomes

- **All tests pass.**  
- **All required interfaces and stubs are implemented.**  
- **This document and all code/tests align with protocols and the system architecture.**

## Next Steps

- For any new integration features or cross-module protocols, mirror this documentation and keep integration test documentation in sync.

## Service Health Dashboard: Developer Usage & Integration Guide

### Overview

The `ServiceHealthDashboard` provides real-time monitoring, auditing, and alerting of all registered platform components and integrations via the ComponentRegistry. It is the central point for querying integration health, visualizing dependency graphs, and tracking history of all status changes.

### Key Features

- Real-time status and dependency visualization for all monitored components
- Component health and state tracking (RUNNING, DEGRADED, FAILED, etc.)
- API for status update, global/legacy listeners, and alert registration
- Complete per-component audit history (with timestamp, metrics, messages)

### Integration Usage

```python
# Instantiating the Dashboard
from app.core.monitoring.ServiceHealthDashboard_Class import ServiceHealthDashboard
from integrations.registry.component_registry import ComponentRegistry

registry = ComponentRegistry()  # Singleton in actual deployment
dashboard = ServiceHealthDashboard(registry)

# Registering and Tracking Components
from integrations.monitoring.component_status_adapter import ComponentState

registry.register_component("MyAPI", state=ComponentState.RUNNING)

# Updating and Querying Status
dashboard.update_component_status("MyAPI", ComponentState.DEGRADED, 
                                 metrics={"cpu_pct": 85}, 
                                 message="Node load spiked")
print(dashboard.status_for("MyAPI"))  # -> ComponentState.DEGRADED
print(dashboard.get_all_component_statuses())
print(dashboard.get_component_history("MyAPI"))  # returns audit trail

# Alerting and Listener Callbacks
def critical_alert(component_id, new_state):
    print(f"ALERT: {component_id} moved into {new_state}")

dashboard.register_alert_callback(critical_alert)

# Dependency Graph
registry.declare_dependency("MyAPI", "Database")
print(dashboard.get_dependency_graph())
# -> {"MyAPI": ["Database"], "Database": []}
```

### Integration Testing

All behaviors and API signatures have been integration-tested in:
- `/tests/integration/monitoring/test_service_health_dashboard.py`

For protocol details, see:
- `/docs/architecture/service_health_protocol.md`
- `/docs/architecture/health_monitoring_protocol.md`
