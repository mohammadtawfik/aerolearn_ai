**File:** `/docs/development/integration_test_documentation.md`  
**Last Update:** (Day 21 cycle)

## Summary

Integration tests were implemented, executed, and now pass for all Day 21 requirements as outlined in `/docs/development/day21_plan.md` for Task 3.8.1:

- **Student System to Content Repo:** Verified that students can retrieve course and content listings via the documented DBClient interface.
- **Progress Tracking to Analytics:** Progress events recorded in ProgressMetrics are reflected in AnalyticsEngine with strict protocol compliance.
- **Authentication Flow:** End-to-end login/session/permission checks pass using the documented Authenticator.
- **Cross-Component Consistency:** Enrollment and progress state are consistent between DBClient, metrics, and analytics engines.
- **Service Component Health Monitoring:** All test components (`Auth`, `DB`, `ProgressAnalyticsEngine`) are registered and visible in the ComponentRegistry and ServiceHealthDashboard.
