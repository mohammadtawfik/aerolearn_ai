# Day 12: Content Analysis Foundation — Plan, Criteria, and Implementation Map

The following criteria, checklist, and mapping define the complete scope for Day 12 of the AeroLearn AI sprint. All items must be satisfied and checked off for Day 12 to be considered done and ready for review.

---

- [ ] Similarity calculation algorithms created with configurable thresholds
- [ ] Cross-course content comparison built with results visualization
- [ ] Similarity-based content recommendations developed
- [ ] Unit tests written for embedding generation and similarity scoring
- [ ] Similarity detection algorithms and configuration documented

---

## ❏ Task 12.2: Build Content Extraction Pipeline

- [ ] Text extraction for PDFs, documents, slides, including OCR, completed
- [ ] Structured data extraction from tables and diagrams implemented
- [ ] Metadata extraction for multimedia content developed
- [ ] Content preprocessing for AI analysis added
- [ ] Unit tests for extraction accuracy across formats written
- [ ] Extraction capabilities and format limitations documented

---

## ❏ Task 12.3: Set Up Vector Database Integration

- [ ] Vector database configured with optimized indexing
- [ ] Efficient vector search with filtering implemented
- [ ] Vector index management and update strategies created
- [ ] Vector persistence and synchronization developed
- [ ] Performance tests for vector operations at scale written
- [ ] Vector DB schema and query patterns documented

---

## ❏ Task 12.4: Content Analysis Integration Testing

- [ ] Similarity detection tested across content types
- [ ] Extraction pipeline verified with complex/real-world documents
- [ ] Vector search relevance and performance validated
- [ ] Cross-component access to similarity data tested
- [ ] Integration test results and metrics documented
- [ ] Technical documentation for the content analysis system created

### Sprint Review Instructions

- Reviewers must verify all items are checked above.
- For each subtask, implementation files, test locations, and documentation must be present and referenced.
- Any unchecked item or critical defect delays sprint completion.
