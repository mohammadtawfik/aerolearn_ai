# Integration Health Modularization Plan: Module Placement & Test API Detail Day24-25

## Background

- `/integrations/monitoring/integration_health.py` has grown to over 30KB and now has multiple responsibilities: health states/entities, provider ABC, orchestration/management, monitoring, integration registry, and notification/event logic.
- **Protocols, architecture overview, and planning docs require modular, protocol-aligned, testable surface for each feature.**
- TDD is mandatory for all future refactorings—split each protocol/API surface, write modular tests first.

---

## Required Modularization

### **Split Into:**

- **`health_status.py`**:  
  - `HealthStatus`, `HealthMetricType`, `HealthMetric`
- **`health_provider.py`**:  
  - `HealthProvider` (ABC)
- **`events.py`**:  
  - `HealthEvent` and event-related logic/listener utilities
- **`integration_health_manager.py`**:  
  - Main `IntegrationHealth` service/orchestration (depends on above modules)
- **`integration_monitor.py`**:  
  - `IntegrationMonitor` (transaction/failure/stats)
- **`integration_point_registry.py`**:  
  - `IntegrationPointRegistry` (registers/maintains system integration points)
- **`reliability.py`**:
  - `ReliabilityManager` (self-diagnosis, health verification)
- **`recovery.py`**:
  - `RecoveryManager` (protocol-driven self-repair)
- **`__init__.py`**:
  - Expose all protocol APIs as per public/project standards

### **All files located in** `/integrations/monitoring/` and `/app/core/monitoring/`

## Physical Placement and Modularization

- **IntegrationMonitor** and **IntegrationPointRegistry** are implemented and maintained under `/integrations/monitoring/` as required for modular, cross-cutting health and integration diagnostics.
- **ReliabilityManager** and **RecoveryManager** are implemented under `/app/core/monitoring/` to provide self-healing capabilities across the system.
- All monitoring/registry core API changes, signatures, and behaviors must be reflected in `/docs/architecture/health_monitoring_protocol.md` and tested using `/tests/unit/core/monitoring/*`.

---

## TDD Requirements for Refactor

- **Before any code is moved**:  
  - Write/ensure modular test coverage for each new module/class.
  - Unit tests for: health status/entities logic, provider contracts, event firing, monitor/registry state, listeners, orchestration, reliability, and recovery.
  - Integration tests for manager/service orchestration and system-wide behavior.
  - Place unit tests in `/tests/unit/core/monitoring/` and integration in `/tests/integration/monitoring/`, one-per-protocol surface.
  - Specific tests for reliability and recovery at:
    - `/tests/unit/core/monitoring/test_reliability.py`
    - `/tests/unit/core/monitoring/test_recovery.py`
    - `/tests/integration/monitoring/test_reliability_and_selfhealing.py`

## API and Test-Driven Requirements

- **IntegrationMonitor:**  
  All protocols, API surfaces, and test requirements match the canonical implementation and update logs as per health_monitoring_protocol.md.
- **IntegrationPointRegistry:**
    - API surface now explicitly includes:
        - `register_point(point_id, value=None)` (**Test-driven requirement: supports both with/without value**)
        - `get_point(point_id)`
        - `get_all_points()`
        - Duplicate registration is dedupe-safe and value-updating.
        - All internal storage/orderings reflect the requirements validated in registry tests.
- **ReliabilityManager:**
    - API surface includes:
        - `diagnose_health(component_id)` (performs self-diagnosis on component)
        - `verify_health_status(component_id)` (validates reported health against actual behavior)
        - `get_reliability_metrics()` (returns reliability statistics)
- **RecoveryManager:**
    - API surface includes:
        - `attempt_recovery(component_id, failure_type)` (initiates self-repair protocol)
        - `register_recovery_strategy(component_type, strategy)` (registers recovery methods)
        - `notify_recovery_attempt(component_id, success)` (notifies registry of recovery attempts)
    - All recovery flows notify integration point registry for cross-system traceability

---

## Documentation

- **Must update on merge**:
  - `/code_summary.md`
  - `/docs/architecture/architecture_overview.md`
  - `/docs/development/day23_plan.md`
  - `/docs/development/day25_plan.md`
  - Any affected protocol docs listing module structure or API.

## Documentation Compliance Policy

- Any change to/extension of these modules must be paired with corresponding protocol documentation and test coverage.
- Documentation is considered final unless further TDD cycles dictate a new field, method, or semantic change.
- This policy applies equally to all monitoring, health, analytics, reliability, and recovery modules to ensure system-wide consistency and testability.
- Future extensions must reference and comply with the analytics module TDD approach documented in `/docs/architecture/health_monitoring_protocol.md`.
- Self-healing workflow must be fully validated against protocols referenced in `/docs/architecture/health_monitoring_protocol.md` and `/docs/architecture/service_health_protocol.md`.

---

## Protocol/Documentation Alignment

- **Protocols strictly enforced:** All classes/functions must keep their current API and behaviors unless protocol docs also change.
- _Adapters/tests must update imports to point to the new module structure; legacy monolithic interfaces should be removed once all is green._
- **Cross-module consistency:** All modules (including analytics, reliability, and recovery) must follow the same TDD and documentation-first approach, with cross-references to relevant protocol documents.
- **Diagrams updated:** All diagrams referenced in `/docs/architecture/architecture_overview.md` must be updated with self-healing orchestration paths.

---

## Implementation Steps

1. **Write modular test coverage for each split surface** (entities, provider, event, registry, manager, reliability, recovery, etc).
2. **Modularize code**, moving definitions into the respective files and updating all internal/external imports.
3. **Run tests and sync docs.** No merge unless all tests pass and docs are up to date.
4. **Validate self-healing workflows** against all protocol requirements and integration tests.

---

## Outstanding Items

- Remaining work: Implementation for other modules (`events.py`, `integration_monitor.py`, etc.) and operational diagrams as flagged for future plan days (see day26+).

---

## Analytics, Reliability, Recovery, and Future Modularization

- All advanced analytics modules and endpoints (`/app/core/analytics/`, `/app/api/analytics/`) are implemented and tested following the same strict TDD and protocol/documentation-first process as monitoring and health modules.
- Analytics methods, fields, tests, and endpoints are defined by `/docs/architecture/health_monitoring_protocol.md` and must remain in sync with all future modularization or system extension cycles.
- Reliability and Recovery modules (`/app/core/monitoring/reliability.py`, `/app/core/monitoring/recovery.py`) follow the same TDD approach with full protocol alignment.
- Any analytics/reliability/recovery API/code/test addition or refactor must:
    - Begin with modular test coverage and protocol doc sync
    - Be listed in `/code_summary.md` and `/docs/development/day25_plan.md` as soon as implemented/passed
    - Update subsystem/module listings in `/docs/architecture/architecture_overview.md`
- As of Day 25 plan closure: analytics, reliability, recovery modules, endpoints, and documented/planned test coverage are fully up to date and compliant.

---

## Documentation

- `/code_summary.md`, `/docs/development/day25_plan.md` fully updated with completion status.
- This plan and completion log now reflect the "done" state for IntegrationHealthManager, HealthMetric protocol, ServiceHealthDashboard, MonitoringComponentRegistry, ReliabilityManager, and RecoveryManager.

---

**This modularization is required to proceed with maintainable monitoring system extension, matches all current documentation, and is in line with the project's TDD/process discipline.**
