# Integration Health Modularization Plan: Module Placement & Test API Detail Day24

## Background

- `/integrations/monitoring/integration_health.py` has grown to over 30KB and now has multiple responsibilities: health states/entities, provider ABC, orchestration/management, monitoring, integration registry, and notification/event logic.
- **Protocols, architecture overview, and planning docs require modular, protocol-aligned, testable surface for each feature.**
- TDD is mandatory for all future refactorings—split each protocol/API surface, write modular tests first.

---

## Required Modularization

### **Split Into:**

- **`health_status.py`**:  
  - `HealthStatus`, `HealthMetricType`, `HealthMetric`
- **`health_provider.py`**:  
  - `HealthProvider` (ABC)
- **`events.py`**:  
  - `HealthEvent` and event-related logic/listener utilities
- **`integration_health_manager.py`**:  
  - Main `IntegrationHealth` service/orchestration (depends on above modules)
- **`integration_monitor.py`**:  
  - `IntegrationMonitor` (transaction/failure/stats)
- **`integration_point_registry.py`**:  
  - `IntegrationPointRegistry` (registers/maintains system integration points)
- **`__init__.py`**:
  - Expose all protocol APIs as per public/project standards

### **All files located in** `/integrations/monitoring/`

## Physical Placement and Modularization

- **IntegrationMonitor** and **IntegrationPointRegistry** are implemented and maintained under `/integrations/monitoring/` as required for modular, cross-cutting health and integration diagnostics.
- All monitoring/registry core API changes, signatures, and behaviors must be reflected in `/docs/architecture/health_monitoring_protocol.md` and tested using `/tests/unit/core/monitoring/*`.

---

## TDD Requirements for Refactor

- **Before any code is moved**:  
  - Write/ensure modular test coverage for each new module/class.
  - Unit tests for: health status/entities logic, provider contracts, event firing, monitor/registry state, listeners, orchestration.
  - Integration tests for manager/service orchestration and system-wide behavior.
  - Place unit tests in `/tests/unit/core/monitoring/` and integration in `/tests/integration/monitoring/`, one-per-protocol surface.

## API and Test-Driven Requirements

- **IntegrationMonitor:**  
  All protocols, API surfaces, and test requirements match the canonical implementation and update logs as per health_monitoring_protocol.md.
- **IntegrationPointRegistry:**
    - API surface now explicitly includes:
        - `register_point(point_id, value=None)` (**Test-driven requirement: supports both with/without value**)
        - `get_point(point_id)`
        - `get_all_points()`
        - Duplicate registration is dedupe-safe and value-updating.
        - All internal storage/orderings reflect the requirements validated in registry tests.

---

## Documentation

- **Must update on merge**:
  - `/code_summary.md`
  - `/docs/architecture/architecture_overview.md`
  - `/docs/development/day23_plan.md`
  - Any affected protocol docs listing module structure or API.

## Documentation Compliance Policy

- Any change to/extension of these modules must be paired with corresponding protocol documentation and test coverage.
- Documentation is considered final unless further TDD cycles dictate a new field, method, or semantic change.
- This policy applies equally to all monitoring, health, and analytics modules to ensure system-wide consistency and testability.
- Future extensions must reference and comply with the analytics module TDD approach documented in `/docs/architecture/health_monitoring_protocol.md`.

---

## Protocol/Documentation Alignment

- **Protocols strictly enforced:** All classes/functions must keep their current API and behaviors unless protocol docs also change.
- _Adapters/tests must update imports to point to the new module structure; legacy monolithic interfaces should be removed once all is green._
- **Cross-module consistency:** All modules (including analytics) must follow the same TDD and documentation-first approach, with cross-references to relevant protocol documents.

---

## Implementation Steps

1. **Write modular test coverage for each split surface** (entities, provider, event, registry, manager, etc).
2. **Modularize code**, moving definitions into the respective files and updating all internal/external imports.
3. **Run tests and sync docs.** No merge unless all tests pass and docs are up to date.

---

## Completion and Status (as of Day 24)

- **IntegrationHealthManager (`integration_health_manager.py`)**  
  ✅ Implemented, protocol and TDD-compliant, all required tests for registration, metric storage, alert/callback, and status transitions **pass**.
- **HealthMetric and StatusRecord**  
  ✅ Protocol-compliant, string-matching and UTC-aware, as per all TDD and protocol requirements.
- **ServiceHealthDashboard (`dashboard.py`)**
  ✅ Implemented, protocol and TDD-compliant; all `/tests/integration/monitoring/test_monitoring_module_integration.py` scenarios verified.
- **MonitoringComponentRegistry / ComponentRegistry (`registry.py`)**
  ✅ Implemented and protocol-synced; supports registration, keyword args, state/history, full TDD coverage.
- **Test Coverage:**  
  All components pass their respective test suites. Registry and dashboard pass all protocol and integration-driven tests for health monitoring.  
  No failures or deviations detected.

---

## Outstanding Items

- Remaining work: Implementation for other modules (`events.py`, `integration_monitor.py`, etc.) and operational diagrams as flagged for future plan days (see day25+).

---

## Analytics and Future Modularization

- All advanced analytics modules and endpoints (`/app/core/analytics/`, `/app/api/analytics/`) are implemented and tested following the same strict TDD and protocol/documentation-first process as monitoring and health modules.
- Analytics methods, fields, tests, and endpoints are defined by `/docs/architecture/health_monitoring_protocol.md` and must remain in sync with all future modularization or system extension cycles.
- Any analytics API/code/test addition or refactor must:
    - Begin with modular test coverage and protocol doc sync
    - Be listed in `/code_summary.md` and `/docs/development/day24_plan.md` as soon as implemented/passed
    - Update subsystem/module listings in `/docs/architecture/architecture_overview.md`
- As of Day 24 plan closure: analytics module, endpoints, and documented/planned test coverage are fully up to date and compliant.

---

## Documentation

- `/code_summary.md`, `/docs/development/day24_plan.md` fully updated with completion status.
- This plan and completion log now reflect the "done" state for IntegrationHealthManager, HealthMetric protocol, ServiceHealthDashboard, and MonitoringComponentRegistry.

---

**This modularization is required to proceed with maintainable monitoring system extension, matches all current documentation, and is in line with the project's TDD/process discipline.**

## All required protocol/TDD monitoring splits implemented, tested, and documentation updated as of end-of-day.

> **Task 1 Integration Test Status (as of [today's date]):**  
> All modularization TDD/integration tests complete and passing **except** the in-progress edge-case in `/tests/integration/monitoring/test_monitoring_module_integration.py`. This case is actively being debugged and will be tracked in this and daily plan logs until it is resolved and merged green.

## Completion and Status (as of Day 24+)

- ✅ All protocol and integration tests (metrics, registry, dashboard, modularization) for IntegrationHealthManager and ServiceHealthDashboard have passed after update to strictly propagate HealthMetric lists and HealthStatus enum values per test/contract.
- TDD process confirmed for all modules, with test and architecture documentation now in sync post-resolution.
- Metrics propagation now correctly handles all edge cases and maintains protocol compliance across module boundaries.
- All integration points properly register, monitor, and report health status changes through the event system.
- ✅ The operational dashboard/report API surface (`/app/api/monitoring/endpoints.py`, `/app/core/monitoring/dashboard.py:get_report_data()`) is now protocol-compliant and fully test-driven as per `/docs/architecture/service_health_protocol.md` and related documentation.
- ✅ Privacy/security output checks are included in `/tests/unit/core/monitoring/test_dashboard_reporting.py`.
- ✅ Dashboard/reporting visualization implementation is complete and verified against all protocol requirements.
