# AeroLearn AI – Day 24 Plan
*Location: `/docs/development/day24_plan.md`*

> ⚠️ **DEVELOPER WARNING – ENVIRONMENT & IMPORT ERRORS** ⚠️  
>
> Recent project history exposed two recurring mistakes that waste developer time and break tests/envs:
>
> **1. Environment Packages:**  
> - **Never install `pytest-qt`, `PyQt6`, `PyQt5`, `PySide6`, or `PySide2` in the project venv unless specifically developing/testing a Qt UI feature.**
> - Their presence can corrupt all test runs with DLL import errors, even if you aren't writing GUI code.
> - Use a separate venv for Qt or GUI work. Document and announce this before merging.
>
> **2. Import Hygiene:**  
> - **Always confirm where models/classes are defined before importing.**
> - E.g., the `Answer` class lives in `app/models/assessment.py`. Importing it from anywhere else causes project-breaking ImportErrors.
> - Use code search or consult `code_summary.md` before changing deep imports.
>
> **Mistakes here create major delays for all. Read this before beginning Day 17–31 work.**

## Focus: Monitoring Integration, System Ops Dashboards, and Advanced Analytics

---

## Fundamental Rules & Process

1. **STRICT TDD**: All new features and integrations start with modular, protocol-driven tests.
2. **PROTOCOL COMPLIANCE**: Only protocol-defined APIs/interfaces from `/docs/architecture/health_monitoring_protocol.md`, `/docs/architecture/service_health_protocol.md`, `/docs/architecture/dependency_tracking_protocol.md` may be used or extended.
3. **TRACEABILITY**: For every change, cite the exact test, protocol, and production file involved.
4. **DOCUMENTATION**: Update or author documentation in sync with feature delivery. See `/docs/architecture/health_monitoring_protocol.md` for field/contracts.
5. **HYGIENE**: Maintain environment/import discipline and avoid introducing GUI/test dependencies unless strictly scoped.

## Key Day 24 Themes

### Task 1: System Integration for Monitoring Modules (3 hours)
- [ ] Integrate error logging, analytics, health, alerting, integration failure, and compatibility modules
- [ ] Develop cross-module test scenarios for end-to-end monitoring reliability
- [ ] Update system interface diagrams and architecture documentation
- [ ] **Implementation**: `/app/core/monitoring/orchestration.py`, `/app/core/monitoring/registry.py`
- [ ] **Testing**: `/tests/integration/monitoring/test_monitoring_module_integration.py`
- [ ] **Documentation**: `/docs/architecture/monitoring_integration.md`

---

### Task 2: Operational Dashboards & Visualization (3 hours)
- [ ] Implement backend APIs for operational dashboards
- [ ] Extend `get_health_dashboard()` and reporting APIs with protocol-approved fields
- [ ] Ensure privacy/security compliance for dashboard views
- [ ] **Implementation**: `/app/core/monitoring/dashboard.py`, `/app/api/monitoring/endpoints.py`
- [ ] **Testing**: `/tests/unit/core/monitoring/test_dashboard_reporting.py`
- [ ] **Documentation**: `/docs/operations/dashboard_guide.md`

---

### Task 3: Advanced Usage Analytics & Reporting (2 hours)
- [ ] Implement cohort analysis, trend detection, and system-wide learning metrics
- [ ] Create analytics queries, summary endpoints, and callback hooks
- [ ] Develop data aggregation and visualization components
- [ ] **Implementation**: `/app/core/analytics/advanced.py`, `/app/api/analytics/endpoints.py`
- [ ] **Testing**: `/tests/unit/core/monitoring/test_advanced_analytics.py`
- [ ] **Documentation**: `/docs/analytics/advanced_metrics.md`

---

### Task 4: Reliability Engineering & Self-Healing (2 hours)
- [ ] Develop system self-diagnosis mechanisms
- [ ] Implement limited self-repair capabilities (e.g., automated restart on health check fail)
- [ ] Create comprehensive testing for recovery flows and alerts
- [ ] **Implementation**: `/app/core/monitoring/reliability.py`, `/app/core/monitoring/recovery.py`
- [ ] **Testing**: `/tests/integration/monitoring/test_reliability_and_selfhealing.py`
- [ ] **Documentation**: `/docs/operations/reliability_guide.md`

---

### Task 5: Documentation & Operational Readiness (2 hours)
- [ ] Update protocol documentation with all new fields and model contracts
- [ ] Prepare operational runbooks with cross-module invocation workflows
- [ ] Create monitoring system architecture diagrams
- [ ] **Documentation**: `/docs/architecture/health_monitoring_protocol.md`, `/docs/architecture/architecture_overview.md`
- [ ] **Testing**: Validate documentation accuracy against implemented features
- [ ] **Integration**: Ensure all documentation is accessible through the developer portal

---

## Modular Test & Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Modular integration/unit tests written (file paths stated above per feature)
- [ ] Protocols reviewed; if new features are needed, protocol docs must be extended before implementation
- [ ] All new APIs/fields must be tracked and documented
- [ ] System diagrams/architecture documentation updated as cross-module features roll out
- [ ] All operational/production code must pass modular tests before merge
