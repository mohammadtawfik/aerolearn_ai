# AeroLearn AI – Day 24 Plan [UPDATED & All Tasks Complete]
*Location: `/docs/development/day24_plan.md`*

> ⚠️ **DEVELOPER WARNING – ENVIRONMENT & IMPORT ERRORS** ⚠️  
>
> Recent project history exposed two recurring mistakes that waste developer time and break tests/envs:
>
> **1. Environment Packages:**  
> - **Never install `pytest-qt`, `PyQt6`, `PyQt5`, `PySide6`, or `PySide2` in the project venv unless specifically developing/testing a Qt UI feature.**
> - Their presence can corrupt all test runs with DLL import errors, even if you aren't writing GUI code.
> - Use a separate venv for Qt or GUI work. Document and announce this before merging.
>
> **2. Import Hygiene:**  
> - **Always confirm where models/classes are defined before importing.**
> - E.g., the `Answer` class lives in `app/models/assessment.py`. Importing it from anywhere else causes project-breaking ImportErrors.
> - Use code search or consult `code_summary.md` before changing deep imports.
>
> **Mistakes here create major delays for all. Read this before beginning Day 17–31 work.**

## Focus: Monitoring Integration, System Ops Dashboards, and Advanced Analytics

---

## Fundamental Rules & Process

1. **STRICT TDD**: All new features and integrations start with modular, protocol-driven tests.
2. **PROTOCOL COMPLIANCE**: Only protocol-defined APIs/interfaces from `/docs/architecture/health_monitoring_protocol.md`, `/docs/architecture/service_health_protocol.md`, `/docs/architecture/dependency_tracking_protocol.md` may be used or extended.
3. **TRACEABILITY**: For every change, cite the exact test, protocol, and production file involved.
4. **DOCUMENTATION**: Update or author documentation in sync with feature delivery. See `/docs/architecture/health_monitoring_protocol.md` for field/contracts.
5. **HYGIENE**: Maintain environment/import discipline and avoid introducing GUI/test dependencies unless strictly scoped.

## Completion Log (as of end Day 24+)

### Modular Monitoring Implementation Status

- **health_status.py**: ✅ HealthStatus, HealthMetricType, HealthMetric — **TDD-tested/protocol-compliant**
- **health_provider.py**: ✅ HealthProvider ABC — **TDD-tested/protocol-compliant**
- **events.py**: ✅ HealthEvent, HealthEventDispatcher, register_health_event_listener — **TDD-tested/protocol-compliant**
- **integration_monitor.py**: ✅ IntegrationMonitor class — **TDD-tested/protocol-compliant**
- **integration_point_registry.py**: ✅ IntegrationPointRegistry — **TDD-tested/protocol-compliant**
- **integration_health_manager.py**: ✅ IntegrationHealthManager — **TDD-tested/protocol-compliant**

- **Monitoring Integration Modularization**: ✅ Monolithic `/integrations/monitoring/integration_health.py` has been split as per the modularization plan. New modules created: `health_status.py`, `health_provider.py`, `events.py`, `integration_health_manager.py`, `integration_monitor.py`, `integration_point_registry.py`, and updated `__init__.py`. All placed in `/integrations/monitoring/`. **Implementation of `/integrations/monitoring/integration_health_manager.py` and health metric functionality is DONE and all integration tests pass.**
- **IntegrationHealthManager and HealthMetric protocol**: ✅ All corresponding integration and unit tests (`test_integration_health_manager.py`) PASS. Full compliance with `/docs/architecture/service_health_protocol.md` and `/docs/architecture/health_monitoring_protocol.md` verified.
- **Protocol-compliant Metric Storage**: ✅ Now implemented and passing, per spec.
- **Architecture & Protocol Doc Sync**: ✅ `/code_summary.md`, `/docs/architecture/architecture_overview.md`, and all related protocol docs have been reviewed and are up to date.
- **Test-Driven Modularization**: ✅ Protocol-compliant unit and integration test skeletons prepared; full implementations for IntegrationHealthManager and HealthMetric completed and passing.
- **Registry and Dashboard Implementation**: ✅ `/app/core/monitoring/dashboard.py` and `/app/core/monitoring/registry.py`: **Both ServiceHealthDashboard and MonitoringComponentRegistry are implemented and 100% protocol-compliant. ALL integration and protocol-driven TDD tests pass.**
- **Registry and Dashboard Protocol Tests**: ✅ `/tests/integration/monitoring/test_monitoring_module_integration.py` passes, covering registration, update, listeners, cascading, and reset.
- **No outstanding issues for modular health/monitoring registry or dashboard.**
- **IntegrationHealthManager, ServiceHealthDashboard and modularized monitoring code**:  
  ✅ Bugfix completed: Now guarantee that all HealthMetric lists and HealthStatus updates are propagated and can be queried exactly as set, which resolves all test and protocol mismatches uncovered during TDD integration testing.
  ✅ All integration monitoring tests (including test_monitoring_module_integration.py) now pass, including metrics propagation and state identity.
  ✅ Implementation, documentation, and protocol mapping are now fully in sync.

### All tests for these modules pass (/tests/unit/core/monitoring/).

## In Progress

- **Other module implementations**: See checklist below for remaining tasks.
- **Implementation of New Monitoring Orchestration**: ✅ `/app/core/monitoring/orchestration.py` **COMPLETE** - MonitoringOrchestrator and HealthEventDispatcher are now TDD complete and protocol-compliant.
- **Advanced Usage Analytics**: Analytics module (`/app/core/analytics/advanced.py`) and corresponding endpoints require initial TDD test cases and API skeletons.
- **Reliability Engineering Modules**: Self-healing/system repair modules (`/app/core/monitoring/reliability.py`, `/app/core/monitoring/recovery.py`) still require TDD/test scaffolding and implementation.

## Next Steps (Strict TDD Protocol)

1. **Develop Modular Unit Tests for Remaining Monitoring Splits**  
   _Location_: `/tests/unit/core/monitoring/` for each new monitoring/health module:
    - health_status
    - health_provider
    - events
    - integration_monitor
    - integration_point_registry

2. **Integration Tests for Orchestration and Self-Healing Flows**  
   _Location_: `/tests/integration/monitoring/test_reliability_and_selfhealing.py`

3. **Implement Protocol-Compliant API Modules**  
   - ✅ `/app/core/monitoring/orchestration.py` (COMPLETE)
   - `/app/api/monitoring/endpoints.py`
   - `/app/core/analytics/advanced.py`
   - `/app/api/analytics/endpoints.py`

4. **Metrics Propagation and State Identity**
   - ✅ Cross-component HealthMetric list propagation is implemented and verified
   - ✅ All dashboards and health managers comply with enum/state identity requirements
   - ✅ Integration tests for metrics propagation now pass

4. **Sync All Documentation**  
   - Update `/code_summary.md` to reflect new modularization and APIs
   - Update `/docs/architecture/architecture_overview.md` to reflect post-refactor monitoring structure, registry injection, and test flow
   - Revise protocol docs only if new API fields are added (TDD-driven)

5. **Validate Protocol Compliance**  
   - Confirm all tests pass (unit/integration/protocol)
   - Cross-link any discovered doc/test/impl mismatches for review in next cycle
