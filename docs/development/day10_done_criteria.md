# Day 10: Course Structure & Organization — Done Criteria (Final, All Passed)

This checklist must be satisfied for Day 10 to be considered complete.

## ❏ Data Model and Core Logic
- [x] Hierarchical course structure (Course > Module > Lesson) created and modelled in `/app/models/course.py`

- [x] Ordering and prerequisite relationships supported for Course and Module  
  <span style="color: green">**Implemented:** `order` fields and self-referential prerequisite relationships are in the models.</span>
- [x] Categories implemented with hierarchy (`/app/models/category.py`)  
  <span style="color: green">**Implemented:** Category model with hierarchical `parent_id`, backrefs to courses, modules, lessons.</span>
- [x] Tags implemented and assignable to any main content entity (`/app/models/tag.py`)  
  <span style="color: green">**Implemented:** Tag model present; many-to-many tag links to course/module/lesson in models.</span>

## ❏ UI Features
- [x] Drag-and-drop CourseStructureEditor (`/app/ui/common/course_structure_editor.py`)  
  <span style="color: green">**Implemented:** UI component, drag-and-drop, order recalculation, prerequisite placeholder.</span>
- [x] Category Multi-Select UI (`/app/ui/common/category_multiselect.py`)  
  <span style="color: green">**Implemented:** Category multi-select UI component exists and is integrated.</span>
- [x] Tag Autocomplete UI (`/app/ui/common/tag_autocomplete.py`)  
  <span style="color: green">**Implemented:** Tag autocomplete UI component exists and is integrated.</span>
- [x] Integrated in main structure editor  
  <span style="color: green">**Implemented:** Category and tag editors are present within CourseStructureEditor.</span>
- [x] Search/filter UI for tags/categories (`/app/ui/common/course_organization_search.py`)  
  <span style="color: green">**Implemented:** Search/filter UI exists per code survey.</span>

## ❏ Automation/Backend
- [x] Tag-based search and filtering implemented and tested (`/app/models/tag_search.py`)  
  <span style="color: green">**Implemented:** Tag search and filtering logic present and confirmed by self-test script.</span>
- [x] Stubbed category/tag suggestion services ready for future AI integration  
  <span style="color: green">**Implemented:** Suggestion service stubs found in the project.</span>

## ❏ Testing & QA
- [x] Unit tests for models (structure, category, tag) in `/tests/models/`  
  <span style="color: green">**Implemented & Passed:** Unit tests in `/tests/models/` (see self-test and pytest runs).</span>
- [x] Integration/workflow/UI tests for propagation and search in `/tests/ui/`  
  <span style="color: green">**Implemented & Passed:** UI tests for CourseStructureEditor, UI controls, and workflows present and all pass (see self-test and pytest runs).</span>
- [x] Self-test script executed and passed (`/scripts/course_organization_selftest.py`)  
  <span style="color: green">**Executed & Passed:** Self-test script run — all status OK (see test results above).</span>

## ❏ Documentation
- [x] Data model and architecture docs for course organization updated (`/docs/architecture/course_structure.md`)  
  <span style="color: green">**Implemented:** Docs specify models, relationships, and expansion points.</span>
- [x] API docs for tagging/search (`/docs/api/tagging_system.md`)  
  <span style="color: green">**Implemented:** API documentation for search and tagging is available.</span>
- [x] Integration doc describing linking and propagation (`/docs/architecture/course_organization_integration.md`)  
  <span style="color: green">**Implemented:** This integration document is present.</span>
- [x] User guide for structure, editing, category/tag workflow, search (`/docs/user_guides/course_organization_features.md`)  
  <span style="color: green">**Implemented:** User guide covers these features.</span>
- [x] This done-criteria doc present and signed off  
  <span style="color: green">**Implemented:** Doc exists, status fully reviewed with all criteria satisfied.</span>
