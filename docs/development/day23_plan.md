> ⚠️ **DEVELOPER WARNING – ENVIRONMENT & IMPORT ERRORS** ⚠️  
>
> Recent project history exposed two recurring mistakes that waste developer time and break tests/envs:
>
> **1. Environment Packages:**  
> - **Never install `pytest-qt`, `PyQt6`, `PyQt5`, `PySide6`, or `PySide2` in the project venv unless specifically developing/testing a Qt UI feature.**
> - Their presence can corrupt all test runs with DLL import errors, even if you aren't writing GUI code.
> - Use a separate venv for Qt or GUI work. Document and announce this before merging.
>
> **2. Import Hygiene:**  
> - **Always confirm where models/classes are defined before importing.**
> - E.g., the `Answer` class lives in `app/models/assessment.py`. Importing it from anywhere else causes project-breaking ImportErrors.
> - Use code search or consult `code_summary.md` before changing deep imports.
>
> **Mistakes here create major delays for all. Read this before beginning Day 17–31 work.**

# AeroLearn AI – Day 23 Plan (UPDATED)
*Location: `/docs/development/day23_plan.md`*

## Focus: Monitoring System Development

---

## 🚦 **MANDATORY TDD AND PROTOCOL COMPLIANCE**

**ALL implementation and refactoring work for Day 23 features must:**
- Begin by writing modular test(s) for each protocol/API surface, one feature per test file.
- Use ONLY protocol-defined APIs/interfaces (see `/docs/architecture/architecture_overview.md`, `/docs/architecture/service_health_protocol.md`, etc.)
- State in your MR/review exactly which module, protocol, and test file(s) your work covers.
- Keep documentation, test modules, and APIs in sync; update docs as features progress or APIs change.
- No production code or test merges allowed without passing all modular tests.

> **For each feature below, modular test files are shown as a starting point. Reference their locations in all related discussions and merge requests.**
