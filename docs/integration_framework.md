# AeroLearn AI Integration Framework

> **Phase 1 Deliverables Documentation**  
> *Foundation for a scalable and modular event-driven architecture.*

---

## Overview

This document describes the **AeroLearn AI Integration Framework** as implemented for Phase 1. It covers module responsibilities, extensibility patterns, and key API features. This framework serves as the backbone for cross-component communication, registration, dependency management, and integration monitoring across all subsequent AeroLearn modules.

---

## Core Modules & Responsibilities

### 1. `integrations/events/`

- **`event_types.py`:**
  - Defines core event categories and priorities
  - Implements standard event types (`SystemEventType`, `ContentEventType`, etc.)
  - Provides the `Event`, `SystemEvent`, `ContentEvent`, `UserEvent`, and related classes, supporting serialization and deserialization.

- **`event_subscribers.py`:**
  - Defines the event subscription pattern.
  - `EventSubscriber`: Base class for all event listeners (subclass or use adaptor).
  - `EventFilter`: Flexible selector (by type/category/priority); allows fine-grained routing.
  - `CallbackEventSubscriber`: Enables function-based event handlers.
  - `AcceptAllEventFilter`: Permissive filter for catch-all handlers.

- **(planned, partial)** `event_bus.py`:
  - Central async event bus (singleton) to publish events to subscribers.
  - Designed for test integration/scaffolding, with full concurrency/extensibility.

---

### 2. `integrations/registry/`

- **`component_registry.py`:**
  - Singleton registry of cross-system components.
  - API for registering, listing, and retrieving component objects.
  - Components support both attribute (`component.version`) and dict-style (`component['version']`) access for compatibility.
  - `list_components()`: Returns all registered component IDs.
  - Dependency and interface declaration included for future extensibility.

- **`dependency_tracker.py`:**
  - Dependency declaration, inquiry, and stubbed validation for foundation tests.
  - `declare_dependency()` and `has_dependency()` for test harnessing/graph manipulation.

---

### 3. `integrations/interfaces/`

- **`base_interface.py`:**
  - Defines the base abstract interface contract.
  - `@interface_method`: Decorator for methods intended as formalized API/contract methods.
  - Supplies base for all further specific interface contracts (`content_interface`, `ai_interface`, ...).

---

### 4. `integrations/monitoring/`

- **`integration_health.py`**:
  - Lightweight health metric collector with get/set API.
- **`component_status.py`**:
  - Tracks up/down/unknown state for any component.
- **`transaction_logger.py`**:
  - Stores a log of cross-component transactions for quick querying.

---

## Key Architectural Patterns

- **Event-Driven Architecture:**  
  All modules communicate via events, keeping components decoupled and extensible.

- **Singleton Registries:**  
  Core registries (components, event bus) use thread-safe singleton patterns for global accessibility.

- **Adapter and Injection:**  
  Events and registration accept both direct class implementations and test/automation adaptors (allowing rapid test evolution).

- **Test Compatibility:**  
  All APIs are specifically scaffolded to interoperate with both real modules and integration test suites (dictionary-like access, stubs where needed).

## Example Usage

### Registering and Retrieving a Component

```python
from integrations.registry.component_registry import ComponentRegistry

registry = ComponentRegistry()
registry.register_component('my_comp', '1.2.3')
component = registry.get_component('my_comp')
print(component['version'])  # '1.2.3'
print('my_comp' in registry.list_components())  # True
```

### Event Subscription and Filtering

```python
from integrations.events.event_subscribers import CallbackEventSubscriber, EventFilter
from integrations.events.event_types import SystemEventType

def handle_event(event_type, payload):
    print(f"Got event: {event_type}, payload: {payload}")

subscriber = CallbackEventSubscriber(
    callback=handle_event,
    event_filter=EventFilter(event_types=[SystemEventType.STARTUP])
)
# Registration to event bus would go here...
```

### Health Metrics/Status

```python
from integrations.monitoring.integration_health import IntegrationHealth

health = IntegrationHealth()
health.collect_metric("uptime_s", 3600)
assert health.get_metric("uptime_s") == 3600
```

---

## Extending the Framework

- **Add New Event Types:**  
  Extend in `event_types.py` or define custom subclasses.

- **Custom Event Filtering:**  
  Subclass `EventFilter` and override `matches()` for patterns (wildcards, predicate logic).

- **Component Lifecycle Hooks:**  
  Any registered component can later implement async `initialize`, `start`, or `stop` for managed startup/shutdown.

- **Interface Contracts:**  
  Create and register new interface specs in `interfaces/`.

---

## Testing & Continuous Integration

- Passing integration tests ensure:
  - Event bus and filtering work as designed
  - Component lifecycle and registry behaviors are correct
  - Monitoring and logging are present and testable
- **Recommendation:** Wire these tests into a CI pipeline for ongoing reliability as new phases/features land.

## Future Directions

- **Finish and robustify EventBus for production (queueing, async, and persistence features)**
- **Enhance interface validation and documentation tools.**
- **Expand component registry to support hot-reload and graceful upgrade of components.**
- **Full integration with authentication, API, and database layers as defined in future phases.**
