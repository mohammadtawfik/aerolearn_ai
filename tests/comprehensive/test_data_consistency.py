Cross-Component Data Consistency Tests

Validate that transactions and updates propagate correctly across subsystems:
- Database, event bus, cache, UI reflection, search index coherence, etc.

# Example: Enroll user in course, validate reflected everywhere
def test_enrollment_consistency_across_system():
    # 1. Enroll user in course (write to DB + emit event)
    # 2. Validate presence in user profile, course rosters, event logs
    # 3. Query via API/UI (if simulated)
    pass

# Example: Admin role change reflected in permission registry and UI
def test_role_change_propagates_to_permissions_and_ui():
    # 1. Change user role in DB/registry
    # 2. Validate with permission checks and UI query
