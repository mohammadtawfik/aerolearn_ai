# Example: Simulate user enrolling in a course and completing a quiz
def test_student_course_enrollment_and_quiz_flow():
    # 1. Authenticate as student
    # 2. Enroll in a course (models, db, event bus)
    # 3. Take a lesson/quiz (content, AI feedback, progress tracking)
    # 4. Validate completion in progress records and event emission
    # (Mocks or test fixtures to be filled in for all major subsystems)

# Example: Admin uploads content, validates propagation and indexing, sees in AI search
def test_admin_uploads_and_searchable_content_flow():
    # 1. Login as admin
    # 2. Upload batch content (upload controller, db, event bus)
    # 3. Ensure content shows in search (AI, indexing, event-driven updates)
    # 4. Validate via API/UI simulation
