Integration tests for the Feature Development Tracker.
Day 20 Plan - Task 3.7.1
Location: /tests/integration/registry/test_feature_tracker.py

Test protocol compliance for:
 - Feature registry creation and mapping
 - Status and progress update tracking
 - Dependency linking between features
 - Cross-component feature tracking
 - Propagation of status updates
 - Compliance with registry/dependency/monitoring protocols
