Integration test for Task 3.7.6: Change Propagation Simulation

Test Location:
    /tests/integration/registry/test_change_propagation_simulation.py

Purpose:
    - To drive the implementation of component change modeling, propagation, and associated planning/visualization tools
    - Follows requirements and protocols from:
        - /docs/architecture/dependency_tracking_protocol.md
        - /docs/architecture/service_health_protocol.md
        - /docs/architecture/architecture_overview.md
        - /code_summary.md
        - /docs/development/day21_plan.md

Key Test Coverage:
    1. Simulate/model a code/config/component change in the registry
    2. Trigger data flow/dependency analysis: verify correct propagation to dependent components
    3. Ensure effect visualization interface is triggered (can be stub/mock if not implemented)
    4. Simulate "migration" planning: downstream tool produces a change impact plan
    5. Integration check: All steps must use registry and dashboard as required by protocols
