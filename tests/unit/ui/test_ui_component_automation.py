"""
Test Suite: UI Component Automation Protocol

This file initiates test-driven scaffolding for UI automation as described in
/docs/development/day22_plan.md Task 4.1.4 and following the modular test design
specified in /code_summary.md and /docs/doc_index.md.

Scope:
 - Automatic UI workflow simulation
 - Event recording and playback
 - Visual regression protocol hooks
 - Backend interaction validation

Locations for target UI code: see /app/ui/ directories in code_summary.md.

Protocol: All test setup/teardown must be isolated and not affect system env.

Note:
 - UI testing is to be separated from core, non-UI protocol tests.
 - If Qt or GUI frameworks are required, ensure appropriate (separate) venv.
